# Face-Detection-Application
Face Detection Application
A simple and robust application for real-time face detection from a webcam feed or from an uploaded image file. This project serves as a practical demonstration of integrating computer vision capabilities with a user-friendly graphical interface.

Features
Real-time Webcam Detection: Utilizes the device's webcam to detect faces in a live video stream.

Image Upload: Allows users to upload a static image file (JPEG, PNG) for face detection.

Visual Feedback: Draws a bounding box around each detected face, highlighting its location.

Tkinter GUI: Provides a clean and intuitive user interface for interacting with the application.

Technologies
Python: The core programming language for the application logic.

OpenCV: A powerful library for computer vision used for the face detection algorithm.

Tkinter: Python's standard GUI toolkit for building the application's interface.

Pillow (PIL): Used for handling and displaying images within the Tkinter window.

Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

Installation
Clone or download the project files.

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

pip install opencv-python pillow

Usage
Run the main script from your terminal:

python app.py

(Replace app.py with the name of your Python file).

In the application window, you can either:

Click "Use Webcam" to start the live video feed and see faces detected in real-time.

Click "Upload Photo" to select an image from your computer.

To stop the webcam stream, click the "Stop Webcam" button.

Future Enhancements
Face Recognition: Add a feature to not only detect but also recognize individual faces.

Multiple Detection Algorithms: Implement and allow users to switch between different face detection models (e.g., DNN-based models for improved accuracy).

Performance Optimization: Optimize the code for better real-time performance on lower-end machines.

Improved UI/UX: Refine the user interface with more modern and interactive elements.
